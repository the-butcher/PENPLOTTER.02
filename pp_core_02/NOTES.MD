- how would the r-value affect frequency and microstepping calculation?

  - being an angular measurement, would it be a 4-th dimension or would it have to be calculated separately?
  - create a poc in javascript

- [x] create a new struct having int32 planar values (scaled) and another Device::accept method for that type
  - [x] work step by step and replace further doubles with fixed numbers
  - [x] revisit and understand the on the fly frequency calculation in Device::pulse
